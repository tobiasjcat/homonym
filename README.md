# HOMONYM

## Concept
This project is a simple web game. While running the users listen to a spoken
word and decide which spelling is correct.

## Set up
Before running, create a folder named `mp3subset` and fill it with audio files
containing spoken words that match the `cleaned_pairs.txt` file. The files must
be mp3s in the format `En-us-word.mp3`  
To run `python3 main.py`
